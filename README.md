# ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Liamvdv
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in distributed systems.
- ğŸš€ I like programming, most of which I do with Go, Python and JavaScript.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently going back and stuying the low level fundamentals of computer systems, i. e. throwing around terminology like virtual memory, cache lines, interrupts, deadlocks and so on. Additionally, I'm learning a form of ASM to understand and appreciate higher level languages like the ones listed above.
